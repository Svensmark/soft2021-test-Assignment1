# 1 REFLECTIONS
## 1.1 Shooting
### A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible reasons for the man not dying.
1. The woman didn't hit the man
2. The woman hit the man, but didn't hit a vital area
3. The woman hit the man, she hit a vital area, but the man was saved

## 1.2 Alien
### An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-by-step instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap anti-clockwise) 
1. There is a glass in front of you in which a toothbrush is located. (A toothbrush is a stick, approximately the size of a hand, which a brush in one of its ends). Grab the toothbrush with your preffered hand in the opposite end to the brush.

2. In the same glass a tube of toothpaste is located. Grab the tube, with the opposite hand to your preffered hand, and use your preffered hand to turn the cap counter-clockwise.

3. Set aside the cap, and gently squize the tube untill the paste comes out. Put the approximately the same amount as the size of a finger tip onto the the brush on the toothbrush.

4. Put back the cap on the tube and screw the cap back on by spinning it clockwise. When the cap is sealed, put back the toothpaste in the glass where it originally was located.

5. Now, holding the brush with your preffered hand, use the other hand to grab the water tap and gently screw the right side clockwise to turn it on with cold water. When the water is running, put the brush under the water to make it wet, and take it out after a few seconds. Turn off the water by doing the opposite to how you turned it on.

6. After toothpaste is put on the brush aswell as wet from water, put the brush-end of the tooth brush into your mouth with the brush facing your teeth. Let the brush touch your teeth and gently move it back and forth. Continue repeating this for 20-30 repetetions, then move the brush to another area. Continue untill every teeth has been brushed both on the outside, inside and over (if the tooth is located in the bottom of your mouth) or under (if the tooth is located in the top of your mouth).

7. When done with previous step, take the toothbrush out of your mouth and spit out the foamed paste. Turn the water on once again (as explained in step 5) and wash the tooth brush completely (only with water). After washing, put the toothbrush back into the glass where it was originally located. Keep the water running.

8. Take a mouthful of water and gurgle the water around in your mouth, then spit it out. Repeat this a few times (3-4 times) then turn of the water.

9. You are done.

# 2 TWO KATAS 
### Complete the following two katas using TDD. Make sure to follow the TDD mantra, “red-green-refactor”: 
### • Red: Write a failing test. 
### • Green: Write the smallest implementation to make your test pass. 
### • Refactor: Make the necessary refactoring to the implementation and tests, in order to remove code redundancy 
### A fuller explanation of the TDD steps can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development
### Remember, the point of these katas is not to solve the coding tasks as such. The point is to use TDD. Thus, if your code contains a solution to the task, but no tests, the solution is not accepted. 

## 2.1 FAHRENHEIT-TO-CELCIUS CONVERTER 
### Use TDD to create a fahrenheit-to-celcius converter. 
1. Implemented in project.
### Use TDD to extend it to a celcius-to-fahrenheit converter.
1. Implemented in project.

føltes lidt spild af tid til så simple funktionaliter
gav faktisk lidt flere ideer til løsninger af 2. del af opgaven.

## 2.2 ROMAN NUMERAL KATA
### Implement an “Arabic numeral to roman numeral” converter using TDD. Follow the  standard form of roman numerals – the rules can be found on the wikipedia page:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Standard_form.  You can test your converter against this online converter:    http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html.
1. Implemented in project.

# 3 GIVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON TDD
### Write your notes (in a readme file) regarding the TDD process, reflecting on the following questions. 
### • What was positive and good about using TDD? 
I think the best thing i experienced from developing using TDD was the fact that i had an idea of how to solve the problem before i even started, because i was forced to think about it before writing code.
### • What was annoying or difficult?
I felt like it was a overdone to use TDD to such simple functionality. Especially 2.1 since it was a simple equation with one input. However i think after adding another functionality it made more sense to have used TDD since it made me realize how robust it mades the code on a bigger scale.
### • What surprised you?
How easy it is to write tests. I have very bad test ethic so i rarely write any tests, but it's very simple and quick to do so, especially when done before the functionality is written at all.
### • Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldn’t otherwise have thought of?
Yes, as pointed out before, it made me start thinking about multiple solutions to the second part of the problem in 2.1, as to extend the functionality. I can't say that i wouldn't have thought of them otherwise, but it was nice to have the ideas before starting to write any of the code.
